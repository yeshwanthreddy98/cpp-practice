//	In a given center n types of products are to be shipped where the number of parcels of products type i is denoted 
//	by quantity[i].A truck can carry a maximum capacity number of parcles with no more than max_parcel_of_same_type 
// parcles of the same type.Find the minimum number of trucks needed to ship all the parcles of all types from 
// this center.

//Example
//n = 2
//quantity = [2, 4]
//capacity = 3
//max_parcles_of_same_type = 2
//ans = 2
//
//n = 3
//quantity = [4, 4, 3]
//capacity = 3
//max_parcles_of_same_type = 3
//ans = 4
//
//n = 4
//quantity = [3, 2, 2, 6]
//capacity = 2
//max_parcels_of_same_type = 1
